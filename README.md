# Adjacency-Pathfinding-GPT

This repository contains a Python script that explores the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT models in understanding adjacency matrices and performing basic pathfinding tasks in graphs. 

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenAI Python library
- tqdm library for progress bars

## generate_adjacency_matrices.py
Generate random adjacency matrices and save them to a JSON file for experiment.

```
python generate_adjacency_matrices.py
```

Select an adjacency matrix size when asking. e.g. 
```
Enter the number of adjacency matrices to generate: 100
```

## gpt_experiment.py
Ask the GPT model to generate the shortest path from 1 to the last point in a given adjacency matrix, and determine whether the GPT path is correct by using the correct path generated by BFS.

Write down your GPT key
```
client = OpenAI(api_key="")
```

Choose an implementation method
- True. If you want to ask GPT to generate all possible paths first, then ask GPT to find the shortest path from it.
- False. If you want, ask GPT to find the shortest path directly.
```
TWO_STEP_PROCESS = False
```

Choose if you want to give adjacency matrices or text descriptions to the GPT model. (True if using test descriptions)
```
USE_TEXT_DESCRIPTION = True  
```

Choose a preferred model. e.g. GPT-4
```
model="gpt-4"
```

Run the script.
```
python gpt_experiment.py
```
